I'm a Climate Scientist who has been working on understanding climate variability and prediction on weekly timescales within a season, which involved analyzing large data sets of observations, simulations and multi-model forecasts using supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.

I really enjoy digging into large amounts of data to find answers to a problem, and through my career I developed a growing interest on data visualization to convey those answers to different audiences.
